# üå± Crop Disease Detection using Deep Learning

## üìú Abstract

The agricultural sector is crucial for global food security, but plant diseases threaten crop yields and biodiversity. This project leverages deep learning to provide a solution for the timely and accurate detection of crop diseases. By utilizing the **ResNet29** model on the extensive **Plant Village** dataset, we aim to enhance disease diagnosis accuracy, ensuring agricultural sustainability. Our approach involves rigorous experimentation, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, showcasing the effectiveness of deep learning in identifying 38 distinct crop disease classes.

## üß† Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Implementation of the ResNet29 model, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, optimized for disease detection.
- **Extensive Dataset:** Utilization of the Plant Village dataset, comprising 54,303 images across 38 different classes, ensuring robust model training and evaluation.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved a testing accuracy of up to 95.35% using a carefully designed training regimen.
- **Automated Disease Detection:** Minimizes the need for manual observation, offering a scalable solution for real-world agricultural applications.
